# Phenology Classifier for Drylands

Local random forest classifiers for dryland vegetation which levereage phenology, average summer surface reflectance, topography, and vegetative structure. Focus is on deciduous riparian woodlands.

NOTE - this repository makes use of git large file storage. You will need to [download the LFS application](https://git-lfs.com/) to retrieve the imagery used to train the classifier. 

Example maps of vegetation maps produced for several focal sites, with riparian woodlands highlighted in red:
