# Phenology Classifier for Drylands

Local random forest classifiers for dryland vegetation which levereage phenology, average summer surface reflectance, topography, and vegetative structure. Focus is on deciduous riparian woodlands.

NOTE - the imagery used to train this classifier is too large to distribute well on git. Please download the required imagery here, and unzip into the main directory of the repository:
